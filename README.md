I'm a tech nerd, a dad, and an emergency physician.

I mostly use python, but I am also interested in bash, go, rust, and swift. My tech interests are broad and range from data science and machine learning to ham radio and electronics. When I think a project may benefit others, I'll usually write it up at [n8henrie.com](https://n8henrie.com) and open source any software that I've written.

Someday I'd like to expand my personal and professional interests to help health professionals leverage technology for safety and efficiency.
